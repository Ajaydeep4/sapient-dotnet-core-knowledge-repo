## **What is code coverage?**

> Code coverage is a software testing metric that determines the number of lines of code that is successfully validated under a test procedure, which in turn, helps in analyzing how comprehensively a software is verified. **Code coverage** is software testing metric that can help in assessing the test performance and quality aspects of any software.



## Benefits of Code Coverage

- For developers, this metric can help in dead code detection and elimination
- For QA, it can help to check missed or uncovered test cases .  
- Helps to track the health status and quality of the source code .
- Help developers to understand bad, dead, and unused code. As a result, they can improve code-writing practices, which in turn, will result in better maintainability of the product quality.

## How Code Coverage  is  measured?

**Code Coverage Percentage = (Number of lines of code executed by a testing algorithm/Total number of lines of code in a system component) \* 100.**



### **code coverage criteria**

----

1. **Function Coverage** – The functions in the source code that are called and executed at least once.
2. **Statement Coverage** – The number of statements that have been successfully validated in the source code.
3. **Path Coverage** – The flows containing a sequence of controls and conditions that have worked well at least once.
4. **Branch or Decision Coverage** – The decision control structures (loops, for example) that have executed fine.
5. **Condition Coverage** – The Boolean expressions that are validated and that executes both TRUE and FALSE as per the test runs.
